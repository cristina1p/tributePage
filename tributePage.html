                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Robert Greene (born May 14, 1959) is an American author of books on strategy, power, and
                    seduction.[1][2]
                    He has written seven international bestsellers, including The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of
                    Seduction,
                    The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law (with rapper 50 Cent), Mastery, The Laws of Human Nature, and
                    The
                    Daily Laws.[3]</p>
                <p>The younger son of Jewish parents,[4] Greene grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of
                    California, Berkeley, before finishing his degree at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a B.A.
                    degree in classical studies.[5] Prior to becoming an author, Greene estimates that he worked about
                    50 jobs, including as a construction worker, translator, magazine editor, and Hollywood movie
                    writer.[6] In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school in Italy, and met
                    a book packager named Joost Elffers.[1] Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and wrote a
                    treatment which eventually became The 48 Laws of Power. He would note this as the turning point of
                    his life.[7]</p>
